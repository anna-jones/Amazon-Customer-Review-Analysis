--Done--

1. Imported:-
            NUMPY for numeric computations,
            Pandas for creating and managing dataframes, 
            NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for implementing NLP concepts, and 
            SEABORN for visualization


2. Created dataframe from CSV file with over 500k records of Amazon reviews.

3. Data cleaning:-
            Removed unnecessary columns:
                                        Time, 
                                        HelpfulnessNumerator, and 
                                        HelpfulnessDenominator

4. Data preprocessing:-
            Grouped and ordered both old and newly created columns  
            Made inferences from data using Pivot table and Heatmap

5. Data Modelling:-
            Vectorized review text using Count Vectorizer,
            Fit the data in Logistic Regression model, and
            Displayed the most common positive and negative words

6. Created functions to compute and display results:-
            Vectorized and fit data with Logistic Regression model, then displayed model accuracy and top words from reviews, 
            Vectorized and fit data with Logistic Regression model, predicted values on test data and displayed model accuracy and confusion matrix for the predictions

--To do next--

1. Implement data modelling using other algorithms like TF-IDF
